# 18 Switch USB HID class 'Game Controller'

This project implements a USB 'Game Controller' with 18 switch (or button) interface ports, intended 
for use with PC flight simulators, to give additional inputs for external control panels.

No drivers required. 

# About This Project

A friend and I wanted a compact USB game controller interface, to provide at
least 10 switch inputs -- primarily for use with MS Flight Sim X and later, Condor Sailplane simulator.

See [`master` branch `README`](https://github.com/gruvin/gswitch18/blob/master/README.md) for some history.

This `smd` branch was created for the express purpose of making my first full PCB assembly purchase from [JLCPCB.com](https://jlcpcb.com). I have no use for these boards whatsoever but wanted to experience having my designs made into reality without touching a soldering iron.

KiCAD 3D Renders have imporved since I last looked!
