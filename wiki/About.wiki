#summary About the gSwitch18 Project

= About the gSwitch18 Project =

A friend and I wanted a compact USB game controller interface to provide at least 10 switch inputs. We had experience with Atmel AVR chips and development tools (OS X and Ubuntu Linux) and research soon found us Objective Development's [http://www.obdev.at/products/vusb/index.html V-USB project].

So we started with a [http://www.kicad-pcb.org KiCAD] design ...

... and ended up with a working v1.0 prototype ...

Below we see a screen shot from Windows 7's Game Controller Properties, showing the device in use, with switch 17 in the 'on' state ...

= Details =

Our device uses an ATmega88p clocked at 12MHz, implementing a V-USB powered (bit-bang) USB HID compliant game controller interface.

Since this is an HID compliant 'Game Controller' device, no drivers are required for the host system, which is nice.

We use KiCAD for as our PCB design (EDA suite) because it is completely free (as in free speech _and_ free beer :-) and we've used is very successfully before for another, [http://gruvin9x.googlecode.com larger project]. (We looked at using the ever popular Eagle EDA suite, but it turned out to be way to expensive for that previous project, due to board size -- by just 5mm or something crazy. So glad we were 'forced' to find KiCAD instead. :-D)

We get prototype PCB's made in China, using [http://imall.iteadstudio.com/ ITead Studio]'s [http://imall.iteadstudio.com/open-pcb/pcb-prototyping.html Open PCB prototyping service].

Please see the Google code 'source' link (above) to gain access to the completely open KiCAD design files and firmware source code.

= Purchase Ready Made =
Limited, hand built prototype boards will be available at the [http://gruvin9x.com/shop gruvin9X online store]. If you can't find the product there, then please use the store's contact form to inform us of your interest. Thanks.
